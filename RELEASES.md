# Version 0.1.1 (2021-05-04)

- Release was created to test docs.rs. Flagging with AOFlagger mostly works and seems to resemble
  output from Cotter with some caveats:
  - does not match for observations where not all coarse channels start at the same time because of
    <https://github.com/MWATelescope/mwalib/issues/22>
  - no optimization, so significantly slower.
