COMMENT After an observation starts, the receiver hardware changes take a
COMMENT few seconds to stabilise. The 24 GPU boxes start saving data to
COMMENT their output files anywhere from a second _before_ the start of
COMMENT the observation to a few seconds after, and not necessarily at the
COMMENT same time on each gpubox.
COMMENT QUACKTIM and GOODTIME represent the start of the first uncontaminated
COMMENT data, rounded up to the next time-averaged data packet. Note that this
COMMENT time may be before the first actual data in some or all gpubox files.
