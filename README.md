A Rust library for common preprocessing tasks performed in the data pipeline of the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA), located on the land of the Wajarri Yamatji people in Murchison Shire, Western
Australia.

**Birli** is the Wajarri word for lightning, a common cause of outages at the MWA, and a great
descriptor for the speed which this library intends to deliver.
